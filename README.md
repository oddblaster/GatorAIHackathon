The power of the community to create health is far greater than any physician, clinic or hospital. We strive to gift people the tools for people of any community to stay connected so in times of disaster,
they can help each other in which first responders cannot. We believe that together, they can lighten the burden and struggles of the experience they gone through and lift each other, allowing them to 
brave through these calamities.
